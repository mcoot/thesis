TODO for SMTP class MailSender
Goal: We want to make a MailSender class which builds on the functionality of Transport/Session/MimeMessage, etc.
	1. Establish SMTP connection (see javax.mail.Transport)
	   Basically need to implement the SMTPTransport.class
	2. Need to understand what javax.mail.Session,etc. and decide whether to replace them with secure versions
	3. Build functionality into Message to send? or send through MailSender class (send it a pre-baked message)
	4. add declassifiers (encrypt message body, e.g.)
	5. add attachments, mime types, etc. (see javax.mail.MimeMessage)
	6. Add field to indicate what kind of crypto is used.
