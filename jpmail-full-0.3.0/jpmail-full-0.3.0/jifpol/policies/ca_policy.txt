// This policy uses a CA to secure email

// should be demonstrable by having public keys of each principal signed with private key of siisCA
// need special policy statement for this?  or could it be the case for all delegations?
// This should be implemented by requiring a check before doing AddDelClosure:
// 		the check use siisCA's public key to verify bono's public key against a siis_ca-signed version of this key
//		the siis_ca signed version could be provided as the authprf for AddDelClosure
//		to do this, we should extract the del principal from AddDelClosure in siisCA's isAuthorized and 
//		check the unencrypted authprf against del's public key
siisCA certifies bono
siisCA certifies p1
//siisCA certifies p2
//siisCA certifies enck
//siisCA certifies lisa

bono allows smtp.EmailRSAClosure(siisCA)
bono allows crypto.AESClosure

p1 allows EmailRSAClosure(siisCA)
p1 allows crypto.AESClosure
