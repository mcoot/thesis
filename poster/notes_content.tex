\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Background/Intro
	
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item IF vs Access Control (simple example)
		
		\item MAC / Lattice
		
		\item Non-interference
		
	\end{itemize}

	\item Project Purpose
	
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item Is IF viable and useful?
		
		\item Specifically: compare the two most mature IF languages -- JIF and Paragon
		
		\item Are either viable in practice? If not, what would they need? Is one more useful than the other?
		
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Case Studies \& Findings
	
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item Overview: Battleships, Conference Management, Calendar Scheduler
		
		\item Battleships: declassification
		
		\begin{itemize}
			
			\item Straightforward declassification of coordinates via special query method
			
			\item Easily representable in both JIF/Paragon
			
			\item Example
			
		\end{itemize}
	
		\item Conference Management: timed release
		
		\begin{itemize}
			
			\item Stateful by necessity
			
			\item Easy in Paragon, needs simulation in JIF (loses type safety)
			
			\item Example
			
		\end{itemize}
	
		\item Calendar scheduler: quantification
		
		\begin{itemize}
			
			\item Requires meetings `owned' by a runtime list of users
			
			\item JIF falls over completely, Paragon gets close but the compiler cannot properly infer
			
			\item Example?
			
		\end{itemize}
		
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Challenges
	
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item Research languages whyyy
		
		\item Difficult to just get compilers running -- (ultimately developed toolchain to help)
		
		\item Conceptually quite difficult -- not policy agnostic so constantly have to think about the policy in code; I think I understand it \textit{now}... after 9 months
		
		\item Lack of compiler maturity: when have you done something wrong, and when has the compiler just broken?
		
	\end{itemize}

	\item Conclusion
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item IF ideas are quite useful: it's often not well thought about
		
		\item Neither JIF nor Paragon presents a viable implementation in their current states
		
		\item Paragon's model seems more likely to lead to a production viable system (more flexible/powerful, easier to learn)
