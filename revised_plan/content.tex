\subsection*{Milestones}

\subsubsection*{Develop Case Studies}

Develop Java, JIF and Paragon implementations of three case examples to illustrate benefits and challenges of security-typed Information Flow approaches.

Specifically, the three examples being used are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Calendar scheduling application --- to illustrate encapsulation of policies
	
	\item Conference management (or equivalent) --- to illustrate implicit flows / `account enumeration' style issues
	
	\item Yet to be determined
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Evaluate Case Studies}

Using the both the final implementations of the case studies and the experience from developing them, create notes evaluating the points these case studies provide in terms of: what security guarantees security-typed IF provides, how useful those security guarantees are in practice, and what burden developing them with security-typed languages incurred.

\subsubsection*{Research \& Evaluate Alternatives}

Do theoretical research into alternatives to the JIF and Paragon models --- including systems like JOANA and LIFTy. These will be discussed in the final thesis, but the case studies will not be developed under them.

\subsubsection*{Design Poster}

Design the poster for the Poster Demonstration.

\subsubsection*{Complete Thesis Writeup}

Finalise the write-up of the thesis itself.
