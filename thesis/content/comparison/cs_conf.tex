\section{Case Study 2: Conference Management System}

\textbf{Explanation}

Conference management system in which papers with a title and list of authors are submitted to the system. Allocations of papers to sessions are then performed, and ultimately the allocations of accepted papers are made publicly visible.

\textbf{Security properties:}

Before allocation release, authors (and indeed anyone bar the organiser) cannot be made aware of what session they are allocated to, or even \textit{if} their paper has been accepted and allocated to a session. (Modelled on real world leak in a system, as per LIFTy paper).

Before allocation release, the titles of submitted papers are visible but the author lists are not (for e.g. blind paper review).

\textbf{Key points:}

The `timed release' policy cannot be modelled in JIF (there is no way to model a time-variant policy).

Hence, for JIF, it has to be worked around with a declassification procedure -- meaning the compiler does not check whether it is valid for this procedure to be called (good example: switching the conditional on the session number function).

Paragon's Paralock construct very easily models timed release. The lock is used like a boolean expression and allows the compiler to easily detect a mistake like switching the conditional on the session number function.

Paragon can also model policy enforcement in two ways: by having a `default' value before information release (as with the session number function -- it may be called anywhere but will only produce meaningful information after release), or by statically checking the lock state (so attempting to call it from code not known to be after release will result in compile-time failure).

JIF can't model these two separate options -- only the former `default value' option can be encoded.

\textbf{Toy examples:}

\subsection{Overview}

The second case study is a simplified Conference Management system. Papers have a title and list of authors; these papers may then be submitted to the conference. Some submitted papers are then accepted and allocated to a conference session, in secret. Then at some point in time the final conference schedule is made available, and previously secret information about which papers were accepted becomes publicly available.

In addition, until the reveal the submitted papers' titles are publicly viewable, but their authors lists are secret (this could represent, for instance, a policy for blind review).

\subsection{Key Security Properties}

There are essentially two parts to the security policy required for this program, which both derive from essentially the same principle of `timed release':

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Until the timed release, whether a paper has been accepted or not may be known only to the conference organiser
	
	\item Until the timed release, the list of authors of a paper is not available to anyone except the conference organiser
\end{enumerate}
