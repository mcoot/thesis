\chapter{A Comparison of JIF and Paragon}

As discussed in the \nameref{chap_theory} section, the Java Information Flow (JIF) and Paragon languages take substantively different approaches to expressing security policies. JIF provides a concrete policy framework in the form of the Decentralised Label Model whereas Paragon effectively abstracts over that to allow for logic-based policy expression.

The differences between these languages are impactful upon how and where they can be applied to real world programs. In this section the languages are compared in concrete terms through a set of three case study applications, with each demonstrating the applicability or the limitations of each language to a class of problems.

In addition, the process of using these languages for development is described in terms of the additional burden they place on the programmer when compared to writing in standard Java. The practicalities of developing in each is discussed, though as research languages both JIF and Paragon suffer from a lack of documentation, and of `production-ready' polish.
