\section{Information Flow}

Language-based Information Flow security has potential application in any application which enforces a confidentiality policy, and where programmer error has the potential to lead to accidental violation of a policy.

As this has been a topic of research for several decades, a number of security typing-based models have been developed. Each of these builds on those that came before and attempts to improve policy definition and enforcement. The model implemented by \citeauthor{denning1977certification} \cite{denning1977certification} allows for verification of programs under a standard MAC lattice. The Decentralized Label Model improves upon this by allowing policies with no central source of truth, and by framing policies in terms of interacting principals. The ParaLock model attempts to address the deficiencies of prior systems in defining dynamic policies in more sophisticated ways than as straightforward declassification.
