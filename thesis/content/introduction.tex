\chapter{Introduction}

The vast majority of computer applications and systems used today interact with confidential information, whether in the form of sensitive government or commercial documents, or in the form of customer data. Users rely on these applications to correctly enforce their intended confidentiality policies and thereby keep their data secure. In practice these applications frequently fail to correctly control confidentiality, and these failures at times result from programmer error, or from edge cases in usage that were not considered in the program's design.
