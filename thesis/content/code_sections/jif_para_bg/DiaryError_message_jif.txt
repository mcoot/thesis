    Unsatisfiable constraint
        general constraint:
                rv <= Lrv
        in this context:
                {Alice->Betty; _<-_ ; this ; caller_pc} <= {Alice->Betty,Mal; _<-_;
    caller_pc}
        cannot satisfy equation:
                {Alice->Betty} <= {Alice->Betty,Mal; _<-_ ; caller_pc}
        in environment:
                {this} <= {caller_pc}
                []

    This method may return a value with a more restrictive label than the
    declared return value label. The declared return type of this method is
    int{Alice→Betty,Mal}. As such, values returned by this method can have a
    label of at most Lrv.
                return secretNumber;
