\chapter{JIF and Paragon} \label{chap_jif_para}

The Java Information Flow (JIF) and Paragon programming languages are both `mostly static' information flow (IF) extentions to the Java language which use type systems to enforce information flow constraints.

As articulated by \citeauthor{broberg2013paragon} in \citetitle{broberg2013paragon} \cite{broberg2013paragon}, JIF may be considered a `second-generation Information Flow language'. Its Decentralised Label Model allowed for more flexible and more useful policies to be expressed than the Mandatory Access Control lattice model that had been central to most prior work \cite{denning1977certification}, and its implementation as an extension of the popular Java language made it comparatively practical to work with.

Under this taxonomy, Paragon is a `third-generation Information Flow language', with policy definition built upon first order logic. This abstraction combined with the Paralock construct broadens the scope of what security requirements can be expressed.

%The Paralock construct which Paragon introduces allow for policies which vary over the lifetime of a running program, something which cannot be represented effectively under JIF's policy model. In addition, Paralocks can model relations between actors of arity zero, one or two, and through the use of binary relations, the Decentralised Label Model can in fact be written within Paragon's policy language. That is, JIF's policy mechanism can be encoded using Paragon's.
